Aikido is more than a physical art, though. Into its techniques are woven elements of philosophy, psychology, and dynamics. It is a way of life that unifies life energy, ki, a way of being in harmony with one's environment and centered within oneself. At its highest levels, it is an effective discipline for the development, integration, and utilization of all of one's powers - mental as well as physical.",

We seek to counter the dominant vision of American law today, a narrow conservative vision that lacks appropriate regard for the ways in which the law affects people's lives. We seek to restore the fundamental principles of human dignity, individual rights and liberties, genuine equality, and access to justice to their rightfulÂ¿and traditionally centralÂ¿place in American law. We want to strengthen the intellectual underpinnings and the public case for a vision of the law in which these values are paramount on such issues as: privacy; freedom of speech; federalism; anti-discrimination and affirmative action; gay rights; a womanÂ¿s right to choose; labor and consumer rights; protection of health, safety, and the environment; the death penalty; and the criminal justice system. At Stanford, we host speakers, panels, debates, monthly roundtable dinners, and visits by judges. We foster community and support for our movement. Our Judicial Review project takes on one federal judiciary candidate per semester and performs a thorough, non-partisan review of their writings. There is lots of room to get involved in major and minor ways, or to just take advantage of our stimulating programming and community-building activities.",

(A prisoner of conscience is a person who has not used nor advocated violence, but been imprisoned, detained or otherwise physically restricted because of their political, religious or other conscientiously-held beliefs or because of their ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, race, or nationality.) Stanford Amnesty was formed to continue the work of Amnesty International at Stanford University and raise campus awareness of worldwide human rights issues.

Garba dances also may include such props as bedlu (a water jug), or supra (a decorated sifter) to incorporate the everyday items used by peasants in the dance. Raas, with similar elements to garba, is different due to its use of dandia (dancing sticks) that are twirled, tossed, and thrown in elaborate choreography. These attributes distinguish it from Indian classical or film dance. This competitive Raas-Garba dance team serves as an outlet for those interested and serious about Indian folk dance of the Gujarati tradition to learn, practice, and perform at cultural and competitive activities both on and off campus. We travel to competitions in Los Angeles, Michigan, and New York City. The team has placed highly in national competitions since its founding, and has traveled to the Best of the Best competition three times.

Watching them tear up and grace the stage, itâ€™s hard to imagine that we have anything similar between us. But, in the end, we are all the same. In the end, what link all of us together are our common origins. No matter how lofty, no matter how great, there was a point where all of us knew nothing -- a point where it all began. Common Origins is a hip-hop group that was founded in the belief that everyone has the potential to be great -- they simply need the opportunity to take that first step. The group focuses on creating a unique environment of both experienced and new dancers performing together, sharing the mutual passion for dance. Common Origins welcomes dancers of all levels. Through our performances, we aim to challenge and train our members with a myriad of fresh, new choreography. As a hip hop dance team, we hope to instill an appreciation of dancing in general, as all types of dancing have their common origins too -- expression through movement. And whether theyâ€™re masters of the stage or just making their debuts, our members dance together as one group -- one family. This dynamic is what defines our time together -- challenging, yet warm and welcoming. So, long after the applause has faded and the lights have dimmed, the show goes on. Because as long as our members remain performers at heart, our mission is accomplished. See, itâ€™s difficult to lose a connection so strong once you discover itâ€™s there: our common origins.",

In 1913 at Howard University, these courageous women wanted an organization that focused more upon the social issues of their time, in lieu of creating one that would cater to social whims of the community. Along with their concern for the welfare of human beings, they also promoted academic excellence and wanted to culturally enrich community life. Although these twenty-two women shared similar values and concerns for humankind, they were each individuals who possessed their own unique inner and outer strengths. Eventually, these strengths came together to produce one flame, one vision whose torch will burn foreverÂ¿ Delta Sigma Theta. Omicron Chi Chapter was chartered June 2, 1983 by Floraline I. Stevens, Director of the Farwest Region, as a city-wide chapter serving women enrolled at Stanford University, Santa Clara University and the College of Notre Dame. The principle purposes and aims of this chapter are to engage in cultural, educational, and public service activities; to establish, maintain and encourage high cultural, intellectual, and moral standards among its members; to engange in public service programs, and to promote and encourage high achievement in education.",
