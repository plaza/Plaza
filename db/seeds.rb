Aikido is more than a physical art, though. Into its techniques are woven elements of philosophy, psychology, and dynamics. It is a way of life that unifies life energy, ki, a way of being in harmony with one's environment and centered within oneself. At its highest levels, it is an effective discipline for the development, integration, and utilization of all of one's powers - mental as well as physical.",

We seek to counter the dominant vision of American law today, a narrow conservative vision that lacks appropriate regard for the ways in which the law affects people's lives. We seek to restore the fundamental principles of human dignity, individual rights and liberties, genuine equality, and access to justice to their rightfulÂ¿and traditionally centralÂ¿place in American law. We want to strengthen the intellectual underpinnings and the public case for a vision of the law in which these values are paramount on such issues as: privacy; freedom of speech; federalism; anti-discrimination and affirmative action; gay rights; a womanÂ¿s right to choose; labor and consumer rights; protection of health, safety, and the environment; the death penalty; and the criminal justice system. At Stanford, we host speakers, panels, debates, monthly roundtable dinners, and visits by judges. We foster community and support for our movement. Our Judicial Review project takes on one federal judiciary candidate per semester and performs a thorough, non-partisan review of their writings. There is lots of room to get involved in major and minor ways, or to just take advantage of our stimulating programming and community-building activities.",

For example, Amnesty International works to ensure fair and prompt trials for political prisoners; abolish the death penalty and other forms of cruel, inhuman, and degrading forms of punishment; end political killings; and secure the release of prisoners of conscience. (A prisoner of conscience is a person who has not used nor advocated violence, but been imprisoned, detained or otherwise physically restricted because of their political, religious or other conscientiously-held beliefs or because of their ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, race, or nationality.) Stanford Amnesty was formed to continue the work of Amnesty International at Stanford University and raise campus awareness of worldwide human rights issues. We engage in letter writing and campus-wide petitioning weekly, with the hope that our work helps to protect and promote human rights worldwide.",
