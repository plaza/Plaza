It is a way of life that unifies life energy, ki, a way of being in harmony with one's environment and centered within oneself.

We seek to restore the fundamental principles of human dignity, individual rights and liberties, genuine equality, and access to justice to their rightful¿and traditionally central¿place in American law. We want to strengthen the intellectual underpinnings and the public case for a vision of the law in which these values are paramount on such issues as: privacy; freedom of speech; federalism; anti-discrimination and affirmative action; gay rights; a woman¿s right to choose; labor and consumer rights; protection of health, safety, and the environment; the death penalty; and the criminal justice system. At Stanford, we host speakers, panels, debates, monthly roundtable dinners, and visits by judges. We foster community and support for our movement. Our Judicial Review project takes on one federal judiciary candidate per semester and performs a thorough, non-partisan review of their writings. There is lots of room to get involved in major and minor ways, or to just take advantage of our stimulating programming and community-building activities.",

For example, Amnesty International works to ensure fair and prompt trials for political prisoners; abolish the death penalty and other forms of cruel, inhuman, and degrading forms of punishment; end political killings; and secure the release of prisoners of conscience. (A prisoner of conscience is a person who has not used nor advocated violence, but been imprisoned, detained or otherwise physically restricted because of their political, religious or other conscientiously-held beliefs or because of their ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, race, or nationality.) Stanford Amnesty was formed to continue the work of Amnesty International at Stanford University and raise campus awareness of worldwide human rights issues. We engage in letter writing and campus-wide petitioning weekly, with the hope that our work helps to protect and promote human rights worldwide.",

Garba dances also may include such props as bedlu (a water jug), or supra (a decorated sifter) to incorporate the everyday items used by peasants in the dance. Raas, with similar elements to garba, is different due to its use of dandia (dancing sticks) that are twirled, tossed, and thrown in elaborate choreography. These attributes distinguish it from Indian classical or film dance. This competitive Raas-Garba dance team serves as an outlet for those interested and serious about Indian folk dance of the Gujarati tradition to learn, practice, and perform at cultural and competitive activities both on and off campus. We travel to competitions in Los Angeles, Michigan, and New York City. The team has placed highly in national competitions since its founding, and has traveled to the Best of the Best competition three times. Tryouts required; with regular practices throughout the year.",

Watching them tear up and grace the stage, it’s hard to imagine that we have anything similar between us. But, in the end, we are all the same. In the end, what link all of us together are our common origins. No matter how lofty, no matter how great, there was a point where all of us knew nothing -- a point where it all began. Common Origins is a hip-hop group that was founded in the belief that everyone has the potential to be great -- they simply need the opportunity to take that first step. The group focuses on creating a unique environment of both experienced and new dancers performing together, sharing the mutual passion for dance. Common Origins welcomes dancers of all levels. Through our performances, we aim to challenge and train our members with a myriad of fresh, new choreography. As a hip hop dance team, we hope to instill an appreciation of dancing in general, as all types of dancing have their common origins too -- expression through movement. And whether they’re masters of the stage or just making their debuts, our members dance together as one group -- one family. This dynamic is what defines our time together -- challenging, yet warm and welcoming. So, long after the applause has faded and the lights have dimmed, the show goes on. Because as long as our members remain performers at heart, our mission is accomplished. See, it’s difficult to lose a connection so strong once you discover it’s there: our common origins.",

								:description => "The founders of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated were a group of twenty-two college-educated women who envisioned an organization that went beyond self-fulfillment. In 1913 at Howard University, these courageous women wanted an organization that focused more upon the social issues of their time, in lieu of creating one that would cater to social whims of the community. Along with their concern for the welfare of human beings, they also promoted academic excellence and wanted to culturally enrich community life. Although these twenty-two women shared similar values and concerns for humankind, they were each individuals who possessed their own unique inner and outer strengths. Eventually, these strengths came together to produce one flame, one vision whose torch will burn forever¿ Delta Sigma Theta. Omicron Chi Chapter was chartered June 2, 1983 by Floraline I. Stevens, Director of the Farwest Region, as a city-wide chapter serving women enrolled at Stanford University, Santa Clara University and the College of Notre Dame. The principle purposes and aims of this chapter are to engage in cultural, educational, and public service activities; to establish, maintain and encourage high cultural, intellectual, and moral standards among its members; to engange in public service programs, and to promote and encourage high achievement in education.",

The current incarnation of the club has its roots in the late 1970s, when many of the individual student initiatives around small businesses and entrepreneurialism coalesced into a single student-lead club. In 1993, the e-club under the leadership of Ken Hawk sponsored the first E-Conference on Entrepreneurship, with 150 people attending the day-long event. The conference has since grown to be the largest annual conference dedicated to entrepreneurship in the world. Today the Entrepreneur Club is the most active student-run club within the GSB community. We have over 300 members and last year the club organized more than 50 events for over 1,100 attendants. The goal of the current GSB Entrepreneurship Club is to stimulate interest in entrepreneurialism among GSB students and other members of the Stanford community. We are passionate about building sustainable ventures and want to provide our members a lifelong learning & support platform to minimize risk and to maximize success in ventures. We want to promote entrepreneurial mind-set both as a founder or manager of a start-up as well as in the roles of an investor, advisor, or corporate partner.",

The JBSA also can voice any important issues that may arise throughout the course of the school year related to being Jewish at the GSB. · Integration and Community-Building ¿ Approximately 15% of the student body at the GSB is Jewish or has a family member who is Jewish. The JBSA strives to help create a little bit of home for Jewish students who are too far away from their families to observe holidays and festivals as they did growing up. We also would like to be a source of information about the Jewish religion and culture for those not acquainted with it, mostly by having celebrations and other programs that are open to the entire student body. · Institutional Memory ¿ The JBSA is an affinity group that provides an underlying connective tissue for Jewish students at the GSB, rather than, for instance, an industry-related club. We do not expect significant evolution of the club¿s mission and modus operandi over time; we do expect execution of our programs and roles to improve over years past. · Communication ¿ The JBSA will serve as the main clearing house for all Jewish happenings at the GSB, on campus, and in the local community",

We develop our own curricula and optimize use of visual aids, activities, and discussions to create an interactive environment with the kids. The program has 10-12 weekly sessions covering important topics for adolescent health such as nutrition, substance abuse, and sexual education. Our goal is to arm them with knowledge and skills so that they can make informed, rational decisions for themselves. Academic credit is offered through HumBio 197S, and can satisfy the Service Learning requirement for Human Biology majors. Work study is also possible. You can also visit our website and look at our curricula at www.stanford.edu/group/help. Please contact any of the leaders if you have any questions.",

In addition, LMSA seeks to improve the health status of these populations through training and community outreach. To foster state and nationwide networking with similar groups, the Latino medical students at Stanford recently voted to change the name of their organization from Stanford Raza Medical Association (SRMA) to LMSA. LMSA at Stanford is an affiliate of the Regional Latino Medical Student Association (LMSA) and the National Network of Latin American Medical Students (NNLAMS). The initial organization, SRMA, was started in the 1970s with a handful of members. The current organization, LMSA, currently has over 70 members and the attendance at monthly meetings averages 20 to 30 students. In 2006, the LMSA chapter at Stanford will hosted the 26th Regional LMSA conference. The 2 day event will took place on April 7 th and 8th of 2006, and attracted a group of 600 to 800 minority students (including medical , premedical and high school students).",

The Stanford chapter of MEChA also supports cultural events designed not only to celebrate the beauty of the Latino community, but also to educate members of our Stanford community on the Chicano/Latino experience.

Students may also visit the SHPRC to borrow books from the library, which is comprised of literature on sex and sexuality. Additionally, the SHPRC spreads information on sexual health through campus outreaches, which are presentations by SHPRC counselors on specific topics (such as contraception, etc.). The SHPRC’s main goal is to inform all Stanford students on safe sex and healthy relationships, and we achieve this goal through our sexual health center in Vaden, and through campus outreaches.",

Our founder felt that the elderly residing in nursing homes in the area were neglected and started the group in order to help the situation. Side by Side is a community service singing group that performs songs from the '20s to '50s at nursing homes and convalescent hospitals in the area. Our vision is to reach out to an audience that is often overlooked, even among community service groups. Music is a powerful tool in breaking barriers that conventional methods sometimes cannot overcome, and it allows us to interact physically and through conversation.",

On the other hand, many Stanford students with Chinese backgrounds are willing and able to provide helpful insights, networks and resources for those curious about China. For these purposes, Stanford needs a student organization which dedicated in bringing everyone who are interested in China together, creating opportunities for people to exchange ideas and share resources, building a community which people could rely on for support and collaboration. People are interested in China for many different reasons: some are attracted by its history and political mysteries, some are interested in understanding the emerging health-care and education problems, some are focused on the huge market potential and many entrepreneurial opportunities. We will build several major sub-groups, and organizing activities around each topic.",

At the event, a variety of crazy activities, costumes, contests, theme changes, student performances, and educational displays keep dancers entertained and inspired for all 24 hours. The year-long planning of this event culminates into an incredible showcase of student energy, unity, creativity, philanthropy, and diversity. In 2008, Stanford held its fourth annual Dance Marathon and raised over $120,000 for Partners In Health. 600 students participated and danced throughout a night of glow sticks, togas, karaoke, and more. This year, Stanford Dance Marathon will again be partnering with FACE AIDS and Partners In Health to unite the Stanford and local communities in their fight against AIDS. Its tremendous success in the past has set the stage for this year’s event to be the largest and most meaningful demonstration of students’ commitment to service.",

The Club originated in 1954 as a two-part exchange program with Keio University in Japan. This was engineered by Professor James Watkins of Stanford through his personal contacts with Keio graduates while working in Nagoya, Japan in the late 1920s. The program originally was named The Keio Committee as part of the Institute of International Relations (IIR), a larger umbrella organization. Even today, the Keio-end of the exchange still is operated under IIR. In 1991 SJEC expanded the program by including students from Doshisha University as well. This year marks the 55th year of our entirely student-run program, and, as always, the goal of SJEC is to promote further understanding and friendship between the U.S. and Japan through cultural interaction.",

The journal will be divided into the three following sections: Investigation: research showcasing salient public health issues and outcomes. Practice: research, reviews, and profiles highlighting practice-based approaches to public health. Examples include investigation of establishing free clinics serving disadvantaged communities or entrepreneurial and design-based approaches to public health crises. Policy: sheds light on broad, systemic policy-based approaches to public health, including corporate social responsibility initiatives and public sector health care reform. The journal’s primary purpose is to create a publication-based forum for discourse centering on public health while providing undergraduates with a meaningful way to engage in these issues through their contributions to the journal. We envision the journal and its accompanying website as a portal for everything public health related at Stanford, including research opportunities, relevant public health classes, service organizations and more. We hope that interested students will engage in these issues not only by reading the journal but by joining as a staff member or member of the editorial board. In this way, the journal will not only raise awareness for public health issues but also provide interested students with more opportunities for tangible contributions to the sector by working on the publication.",

In recent years, we have experienced much competitive success; last season, we second in the nation and have constistently qualified teams to the National Championships throughout our program's history. Additionally, members of the Stanford team have been among those designated as the ten Outstanding Attorneys and Witnesses at the Regional and National competitions. As the organization has grown, the mission of Mock Trial has also expanded to include outreach to the local community, particularly high school students who lack the resources to fully develop their Mock Trial abilities. Every year, our team puts on a Mock Trial Symposium which provides instruction on evidence rules, courtroom prodedure, and public speaking skills.",

We have many levels of runners, from those who have never run before to marathoners and ex-Stanford runners. In addition to the many Stanford undergraduate and graduate club members, we have professors, university staff, and even visiting high-schoolers come out and run with us. Pooling all of Stanford's runners, we guarantee that there will always be someone with whom you can run. In addition, we reimburse race entry fees. If you come, you will be entering an environment that inspires running and that will keep you fit. So, whether you are looking to stay in shape, find a team, or just have a relaxing activity, come on out and join us for a run.",

After our first year, the undergraduate student body voted to grant us funding through Special Fees, and we have used that money for, among other things, FREE ADMISSION to our shows, including Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Twelfth Night, Othello, Macbeth, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Two Gentlemen of Verona, King Lear, The Merry Wives of Windsor, The Tempest, and, coming this year, Julius Caesar and As You Like It. We also conduct Shakespeare performance workshops at local schools, bringing the Bard's text to life for high school drama and English courses as a part of our community outreach program. We have also taken the group (fundraising by our own initiative) to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the largest Shakespeare festival in the world.",

This organization will initially focus on planning educational programming for the Stanford community about women¿s health and human rights issues. We intend to help spread the message that women¿s health is not just a woman¿s issue and will actively work to engage men in recognizing and addressing the unique needs of women as a crucial component in the process of improving these various other societal concerns. Second, as we develop relationships with local and global women¿s organizations addressing these issues, we will create and centralize resources for students interested in finding internships and jobs. We will collaborate with on-campus resources such as the Career Development Center and Haas Center for Public Service so that this information is easily accessible to anyone in the Stanford community.",

Provide aspiring computer science professionals with tools to compete. 3. Encourage more women to pursue Computer Science, as it is fun! :) Most of all we wish to build a community of women who enjoy Computer Science and to provide an outlet for women to share and receive advice or simply discuss what is going on in the field. Some of the activities we have held in the past include Women Faculty Series, Advising Session for Masters Students, ice-skating social, bi-weekly teas, and lunches for informal discussion.",
